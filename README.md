# MySQL DBAL

MySQL extensions for [Doctrine DBAL](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal).

`Pharako\DBAL\Connection` is an extension of `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`—all functionality you get from the latter is also contained in the former, with a few add-ons specific to databases compatible with MySQL:

* multiple inserts
* single and multiple _upserts_ (update records if they exist, insert them otherwise)

## Supported databases

* MySQL
* MariaDB

## Requirements

PHP 8.0 and above. See the [releases page](https://github.com/pharako/mysql-dbal/releases) for previous versions that still work with PHP < 8.0.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```SHELL
$ composer require pharako/mysql-dbal
```

## Usage

### Instantiation and configuration

Most PHP frameworks will have some sort of service injection functionality to help you with configuration, but nothing stops you from doing it by hand.

#### Manually

```PHP
use Doctrine\Common\EventManager;
use Doctrine\DBAL\Configuration;
use Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOMySql\Driver;
use Pharako\DBAL\Connection;

$params = [
    'dbname' => 'my_db',
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'user' => 'username',
    'password' => '***',
    'driver' => 'pdo_mysql'
];

$dbal = new Connection(
    $params,
    new Driver(),
    new Configuration(),
    new EventManager()
);
```

#### Symfony 2 and above

Just specify the DBAL connection class under `wrapper_class` in `config.yml`. All other configurations should remain the same:

```YAML
doctrine:
    dbal:
        dbname: %database_name%
        host: %database_host%
        port: %database_port%
        user: %database_user%
        password: %database_password%
        driver: pdo_mysql
        wrapper_class: 'Pharako\DBAL\Connection'
```

You can read [Doctrine DBAL Configuration](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/doctrine.html#doctrine-dbal-configuration) for more information on `wrapper_class` and other options.

## Extra functionality

Pharako's additional methods follow the structure of Doctrine's [data retrieval and manipulation](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/data-retrieval-and-manipulation.html) functionality, including [binding types](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/data-retrieval-and-manipulation.html#binding-types).

### Multiple inserts

You can insert multiple records with one call—this will hit the database only once:

```PHP
$data = [
    [
        'name' => 'Foo',
        'family_name' => 'Bar'
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'Fuzz',
        'family_name' => 'Bazz'
    ]
];

$dbal->insert('my_table', $data);
```

Or, if you want to specify the types of the data to be inserted:

```PHP
$dbal->insert('my_table', $data, [\PDO::PARAM_STR, \PDO::PARAM_STR]);
```

### Single and multiple upserts (update if present, insert if new)

Before using this functionality, make sure you read [_Careful with those upserts_](#careful-with-those-upserts) below.

Building on the previous example and assuming the `name` field is a unique key in the table structure, the first two records will have their `family_name` fields updated to `Rab` and `Zabb`, respectively, and the last one will be inserted:

```PHP
$data = [
    [
        'name' => 'Foo',
        'family_name' => 'Rab'
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'Fuzz',
        'family_name' => 'Zabb'
    ],
    [
        'name' => 'New',
        'family_name' => 'Foo'
    ]
];

$dbal->upsert('my_table', $data);
```

Again, this will hit the database only once.

If you want your upsert to update only a few columns and leave all the others untouched, you can pass it an array specifying those columns:

```PHP
$data = [
    'who' => 'Them',
    'where' => 'There',
    'when' => 'Sometime',
    'why' => 'Because'
];

$dbal->upsert(
    'another_table',
    $data,
    [\PDO::PARAM_STR, \PDO::PARAM_STR, \PDO::PARAM_STR, \PDO::PARAM_STR],
    ['where', 'when']
);
```

In this example, if the upsert results in an update, only the `where` and `when` fields will be updated. If the upsert results in an insert, all fields will be included.

#### Careful with those upserts

By and large, it is safe to execute upserts against tables of varied structures—those containing a single unique index, a multi-column unique index or even multiple unique indexes.

However, because upserts in MySQL are more involved than simple inserts and updates, you should **not** expect those methods to behave similarly in 100% of the cases (for example, `LAST_INSERT_ID()` in the context of an upsert may behave slightly differently than in that of an insert).

That's why the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-on-duplicate.html) says that _"In general, you should try to avoid using an `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause on tables with multiple unique indexes"_ and _"[...] an `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statement against a table having more than one unique or primary key is also marked as unsafe."_

Despite that, upserts will work just as expected but in [edge case scenarios](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=58637). If you want to play it extra safe, though, try to **tighten your tests** and make sure you get the expected results when the upsert updates your records as well as when it inserts them.
